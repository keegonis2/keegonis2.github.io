  "body": "## Introduction\r\nYou have probably heard of this, in one way or another. Whether it be called income inequality, the collapse of the middle class, increased poverty rates, or just some graph you found on the internet. All of these things can be traced back to one big collapse, the collapse of the working class. Before we go any further I should probably explain what I mean by working class; The working class the class that works for a living, the miner, the office worker, pretty much anyone who works for a wage. This is often referred to as the proletarians, but I will also be expanding it to include the small business owners and such, because they have been affected just as much.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe problem is no small one, all the wealth in the world is being concentrated into a very small group of people. For example, the top 62 people have more money than all of the bottom half of the world combined, and that's down from 388 in 2010. This means the top 62 people have more than 56 million times as much money as the average person in the bottom 50%.  The top 1% of the world owns 48% of the wealth as of 2014, and predictions have them having the majority by the end of 2016. In 2007 the bottom 60% owned 4.2% of all wealth in the United States, the bottom 40% only owning 0.2%. Of that measly 0.2%, the bottom half of that is actually negative because of debt. That is just in the US, and from 9 years ago. Today it is even worse, and worse than that in the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it isn’t getting much better, either. The so called ‘recovery’ after the 2008 crash only benefitted the top 7%, the rest actually got worse. The net worth of the bottom 93% has gone down 4% on average, and the top 7% has gone up 25%. As I said earlier, the number of the richest people it takes to get the same wealth of the bottom 50% combined. Also, it is predicted by that the end of 2016 the top 1% of people will own the majority of the wealth in the world. Money means power, and all of it being centralized in one place is a really bad idea. It is effectively turning the world into an oligarchy of the richest of the rich, which is a world most people don’t want to live in. They also have massive political power, politicians have to decide whether to do what is in the best interest for the people that paid for them to be there(campaign funds, etc), or the people that voted for said person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem however is not the increasing wealth in the few, but the decreasing in the many. Sure, lots of developing countries are coming out of poverty, but as we can see in developed countries that won’t last forever. In 2014, the recorded poverty rate was around 14.8% of all americans, up from 12.5% in 2007. That means that around one out of every 7 people you see are under the poverty line. Child poverty is even worse, one out of every 3 children are in poverty. America is one of the worst countries poverty-wise in the developed world, and if it continues to rise we will be in for a problem.\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most controversial part of the problem, with solutions ranging from giving the rich and companies tax breaks, to communism. Let's start at the beginning, tax cutting and other similar things. The theory is if you give the higher ups tax breaks, it will eventually trickle down to you in things such as more jobs and cheaper goods. The is most often called trickle down economics, and some people call it “Reaganomics” as popularized by former US president Ronald Reagan. Unlike a lot of these theories, this was put into place 30 years ago, and I obviously hasn’t helped anything. The most popular one by far is higher taxes on the rich, or more commonly known as a progressive tax system. This makes the rich pay more tax proportionally. This can help, but there are also plenty of loopholes and once you collect the extra money there is the question of where it is going to go. The most common belief is to redistribute it in the form of free upper education, healthcare, a welfare system, etc. These people often refer to themselves as democratic socialists, but the much more accurate term for them is social democrats/welfare capitalists, since they are far from socialists. \r\n\r\nThere are also much more radial systems, such as having a huge wealth redistribution directly down to the people, putting a cap on how much money you can have, etc. This would also fit into the social democrat category. The most radical approach(but possibly the most effective and permanent) is to abolish capitalism altogether. These people go by all sorts of names such as socialists, communists, marxists, maoists, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists, and many more. For the most part, these people believe that this was to be expected with capitalism, and the system in itself is exploitation and that the workers need to own the means of production. This is called the labour theory of value, popularized by Karl Marx. I suggest you watch this video for a bettery understanding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz3eOb6Yl1s The most interesting part of this is that Karl Marx pretty much predicted the exact situation we are in today more than 150 years ago. \r\n\r\nThe part where this solution starts to divide in is what to do afterwards. Some people, like Marxists, believe there should be an intermediary state called socialism, where the state still exists. Others such as Anarchists and myself believe that both the state and capitalism should be abolished(keep in mind that no state does not mean no rules, just no centralized power). The main criticisms to all of these solutions are pointing to countries like the USSR and China. While they called themselves communist, they were more accurately named state capitalists, because the state owned everything, not the workers. Also, a system like this has never existed for more than a couple years before being defeated(such as anarchist Spain). Overall, all of these people agree on the problem, but disagree on what to do once it has been solved.\r\n\r\nOverall, all of these solutions have merit(except maybe trickle down, because it didn’t work). Somehow, if this is ever going to be solved we need all the people united under one front, otherwise it will go nowhere. It is obvious that somehow this must be solved, and will most likely be the defining problem of the next couple of decades, and somehow we need to fix it.\r\n\r\n## Bibliography\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\"62 People Own the Same as Half the World, Reveals Oxfam Davos Report.\" 62 People Own the Same as Half the World, Reveals Oxfam Davos Report.
